# Click It!
This game works much like the game "Simon" produced by Milton Bradley (now Hasbro). 
However, it's layout follows the model of "Touch Me" by Atari more closely; 
I believe the touching colors in the middle allow a more enjoyable experience 
when using a pointing device. The buttons are still large enough to enable 
easy touch-screen access, too.
